Low Noise, improved Moving-Coil Phono Pre-Amp

## Purpose
An optional _previous_ stage for **MM Phono preamps** like [TuchAudio 101b](../../../ta101b), allowing the use of **Moving Coil** cartridges. _With suitable wiring_ it could be used with other preamps as well, like the [103](../../../ta103) board.

A _built-in relay_ allows the **same input connector** to be used with both **MC** (thru amplification) and **MM cartridges** (_bypassing_ it straight to the MM Phono stage)

## Design
The use of **four _common-base_ stages in parallel**  provides **low input impedance** (100 Ω) and **improved _signal-to-noise_ ratio** (by 6 dB).

_Symmetrical power supply_ thru **serial regulation** provides high PSRR.

## Specs
- **Power supply:** +/-9V, _symmetrical_ (just a few mA)
- **Gain:** x33 (+34 dB)
- **Input Sensitivity:** 0.11 mV over 100 Ω (for a 3.6 mV output, suitable for [TuchAudio 101b preamp](../../../ta101b) or [TuchAudio 103](../../../ta103))
- **Nominal Output level:** 3.6 mV over 110 kΩ (from a 0.11 mV input)
- **Output impedance:** 3.3 kΩ. _Lower load impedances are allowed, but diminished output level and impaired bass response are to be expected_.
